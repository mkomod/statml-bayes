# Contrastive Learning

More figures and details for Experiment 3.3 (Learning a Gaussian mixture using neural network classifier): [Single layer NN](https://github.com/mkomod/statml-bayes/blob/master/python/nn_classification.ipynb) and [Multi-layer NN](https://github.com/mkomod/statml-bayes/blob/master/python/nn_classification_bigger_nn.ipynb)
(to run, either install relevant Python packages or build conda environment from [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mkomod/statml-bayes/blob/master/python/requirements.txt))

Reproduce experiment from Hermans et al., 2020 : [install the hypothesis package first](https://github.com/montefiore-ai/hypothesis/)
